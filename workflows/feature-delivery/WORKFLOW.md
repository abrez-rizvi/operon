# Feature Delivery Workflow

A sequenced route for delivering complete, lean, and fully-tested features without over-engineering or silent assumptions.

```text
[Phase 1: Align]       [Phase 2: Build]               [Phase 3: Verify & Close]
  grilling        ──►    tdd (Seam Test)        ──►    operon diff (Ceiling Check)
                         ponytail (Minimal Diff         operon clean
                                   + Monolith Cap)      handoff (Exit-Only)
```

## Phase 1: Align & Scope (Entry)
* **Skill Bundled:** `skills/grilling`
* **Action:**
  1. Inspect existing code and domain architecture.
  2. Compute the frontier of unsettled decisions.
  3. Ask frontier questions in batched rounds phrased so "yes" accepts the recommended path.
* **Phase Gate:** Stop when the frontier is empty and the specification is mutually agreed upon.

---

## Phase 2: Implement (In-Flight)
* **Skills Bundled:** `skills/tdd`, `skills/ponytail`
* **Action:**
  1. **Seam Test First:** Use `tdd` to identify the public interface and write one failing test (vertical slice).
  2. **Minimal Pass:** Use `ponytail` decision ladder:
     - Check `operon helpers` before creating utilities.
     - Prefer standard library / platform features over new dependencies.
     - Enforce Monolith Ceiling: Decompose into sibling modules if any file exceeds 600 LOC.
     - Write the minimum code required to pass the test.
  3. **Repeat:** Advance slice by slice until feature requirements are satisfied.
* **Phase Gate:** All test cases green, zero unrequested abstractions or dependencies, files within 600 LOC ceiling.

---

## Phase 3: Verify & Close (Wrap-up)
* **Tools / Skills Bundled:** `operon diff`, `skills/handoff` (Exit-Only)
* **Action:**
  1. Run `.\tools\operon.ps1 diff` (or `./tools/operon.sh diff`) to confirm net LOC delta, verify zero dependency bloat, and check monolith limits.
  2. Mark any deliberate deferred items as `// shortcut: <limit>, upgrade: <trigger>`.
  3. **Closure:** If pausing or ending the session, run `handoff` to write `.handoff.md`. For normal turn completions inside an active session, report metrics directly without writing `.handoff.md`.

---

## Adaptive Entry & Fast-Paths
* **Skip Phase 1 (Align):** If the user provides an exact, unambiguous interface or spec, skip `grilling` and jump directly into Phase 2 (Build).
* **Targeted Verification Only:** If the user asks only to inspect diffs or prepare a handoff, enter Phase 3 directly without re-executing implementation.
